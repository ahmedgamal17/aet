The videos were shown in different categories such as \"Parking Fools\", \"Drunk Fools\", \"Criminal Fools\", and \"Fools jumping off things they shouldn't be jumping off of\". As would be expected, some categories see more entries than others, and the categories that feature episode-to-episode are not bound to a predetermined structure.",

While helping and saving as many animals as possible Luke immerses himself into the different cultures and traditions of each country he visits. With long hours, little sleep, life on the road to contend with and daily activities that involve anything from anesthetizing a leopard to educating local people about animal welfare issues, Luke takes everything in his stride. Building on Luke's charm, passion and enormous on-screen presence the stories will shock, appall and inspire the audience in equal measure as Luke travels across the open plains of Africa, the tropical rain-forests of South America and the mountains of Nepal. In each episode Luke deals with huge moral questions that will put his veterinary knowledge to the test, creating a series packed full of drama alongside aspirational stories of people who dedicate their lives to animal welfare and selflessly seek to better the natural world around them.",
