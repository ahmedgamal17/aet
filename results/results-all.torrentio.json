It showcases clips, sometimes viral, of people making themselves look like \"Fools\", often by accident. Many clips were from CCTV footage. The videos were shown in different categories such as \"Parking Fools\", \"Drunk Fools\", \"Criminal Fools\", and \"Fools jumping off things they shouldn't be jumping off of\". As would be expected, some categories see more entries than others, and the categories that feature episode-to-episode are not bound to a predetermined structure.",
