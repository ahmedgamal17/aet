All they must do is sign a contract with Kyubey and agree to take on the duty to fight abstract beings called 'witches' that spread despair to the human world, and in return, each one of them will be granted any single wish they desire. However, as Homura's omen suggests, there might be far more to becoming a magical girl than Madoka and Sayaka realize... \n\nNotes:\n- Due to the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, the broadcasts of episodes 11 and 12 were delayed and were later aired as a double feature on April 21, 2011.",

To protect Arma, the resistance group ARMS assigns the dual Mecha-ude user Aki Murasame to follow him wherever he goes.

When Aki's life is threatened by this group, Hikaru must team up with Arma to find the courage to fight back and, along the way, learn that his life will never be ordinary again. \n(Source: MAL Rewrite)",

As he gazed at it idly, it suddenly began to move, wagging its tail and coming closer to him. “A mushroom...dog?”\n\nDespite his doubts, he decides to live with this mysterious creature, “Kinokoinu\" (Mushroom Dog).

This is a slightly mysterious and heartwarming animation that depicts the funny days of Hotaru and everyone together with Kinokoinu, who is too mysterious in many ways.\n(Source: Crunchyroll News, edited)",
